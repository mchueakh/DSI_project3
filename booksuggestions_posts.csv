Several years ago I was in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program back in high school.

* The Bernie Gunther series by Phillip Kerr
* The Sam Wyndham series by Abir Mukherjee
* The Kane &amp; Abel series by Jeffrey Archer
* The Century Trilogy by Ken Follett
* The Clifton Chronicles by Jeffrey Archer

What I am looking for:

* Gripping narratives that feel 'un-put-down-able' - thrillers usually do it for me
* Possibly set in different parts of the world (allowing for an interaction with/learning of the region's history while also being immersed in the 'main story')
* A bonus/nice-to-have would be if they come in audiobook form

What I am NOT looking for:

Here are some that I have read and that I have enjoyed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Pillars of the Earth/Kingsbridge series by Ken Follett&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bernie Gunther series by Phillip Kerr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sam Wyndham series by Abir Mukherjee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kane &amp;amp; Abel series by Jeffrey Archer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Century Trilogy by Ken Follett&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Clifton Chronicles by Jeffrey Archer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gripping narratives that feel &amp;#39;un-put-down-able&amp;#39; - thrillers usually do it for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly set in different parts of the world (allowing for an interaction with/learning of the region&amp;#39;s history while also being immersed in the &amp;#39;main story&amp;#39;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bonus/nice-to-have would be if they come in audiobook form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am NOT looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A narrative that is for all intents &amp;amp; purposes a re-telling of events with the slight shift of being from the vantage point of a different character&lt;/li&gt;

,booksuggestions," 

I'm going through a mindset shift and as always, look to books for guidance. I'm looking for ***contemporary fiction*** or memoir centered on characters with non-monogamous lifestyles. 

What I'm looking for:

* Myself and my experience (discovering polyamory, hoping to open up a marriage, navigating difficult situations therein) represented in contemporary fiction.

What I'm not looking for:

* Erotica (though sex scenes are fine, I don't want sex to be the central draw of the book)
* Non-fiction guides like The Ethical Slut
* Sci-fi/Fantasy (which is normally totally up my alley, but currently I need something more real-life, fewer aliens and magic)

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myself and my experience (discovering polyamory, hoping to open up a marriage, navigating difficult situations therein) represented in contemporary fiction.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m not looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erotica (though sex scenes are fine, I don&amp;#39;t want sex to be the central draw of the book)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-fiction guides like The Ethical Slut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sci-fi/Fantasy (which is normally totally up my alley, but currently I need something more real-life, fewer aliens and magic)&lt;/li&gt;

,booksuggestions,"So, I have a weird request, and I will give a little back story. My friend LOVES her birthday. It is on the May 24 long weekend (or Victoria Day) and she celebrates for the entire weekend every year. She also celebrates for the month. And if we let her she pre celebrates at our birthday in April and for the whole summer. It's really just a joke in our friend group.

This year she is turning 30 and we are giving into her shenanigans and giving her 30 days of birthday in sort of an advent calendar box. We have planned each gift based on something we talked about on each corresponding day the year before. 

One of the gifts is to be a book. I was originally thinking just any book, and then I thought maybe a book about a wedding or something because she's getting married this year as well. And then I thought... A book set around a BIRTHDAY! It would be perfect. 

After much googling, there are only options for children's books about birthdays. Which could work too because she's a teacher but another gift is a children's book so we wanted an adult book.

,booksuggestions,"hey there, reddit! 

The Name of the Wind is currently my favorite book, I absolutely loved it, when I first read it. The second book was not really my cup of tea, as a certain arc, even if enjoyable to read, stretched a bit too long in my opinion. When I looked for books similar to TNOTW I stumbled upon Brandon Sanderson, who is well loved by many fantasy fans and people left and right are talking about how great Stormlight, or Brandon Sanderson in general, is. I'm interested but intimidated at the same time. The page count is quite high for my experience as a ''beginner'' reader. Should I pick it up? What are your thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

To come to the second part of my headline: 

I just finished Piranesi by Susanne Clarke and Pan's Labyrinth by Cornelia Funke.

 I liked Piranesi and its mysterious concepts, even if sometimes a bit hard to read (the discriptive style sometimes frustrated me) but overall it was a fun read. The biggest intrigue for me was the initial randomness when I first read about the ''house with hundreds of halls, which sometimes gets flooded and its mysterious statues''. I really like unexplanable, mysterious things in books. I don't need much explanation, if it's written in a convincing way. Don't get me wrong, explanations are great and can bring huge amounts of satisfaction once it ''clicks'' but not knowing what was going on for most of the book and really slowly getting a grasp of things is what made Piranesi great for me.

On the other hand, Pan's Labyrinth easily became one of my favorite books. It was such an easy and enjoyable read, I read it in two sessions and loved every single word of it. Everything just fitted. I'm a huge fan of fairy tale like stories, which is why I loved this book so much. It filled me with a child like wonder and just felt absolutely magical.

If there are any books that go in either of these books direction storywise that you might know of, I absolutely have to know what they're called! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance! :)

,booksuggestions,"Hi, everyone.

I'm looking to get back into reading fiction, but I'm having trouble finding something that interests me.

I can be quite picky, so please bare with me. My preferences are the following:  


**REQUIRED:**

* A setting based on, or loosely based on, West Asia, the Mediterranean, and/or East Europe. It can be real or fantastical.
   * Take for example the series *Dune* by Frank Herbert and Brian Herbert. It is most certainly a unique world, but many settings, concepts, themes, and ideas are based on West Asia. This, coupled with the geopolitical intrigue, is the reason why I'm interested in this series. I would also enjoy immersing myself in a unique world largely based on Italy, Greece, Turkey, and/or Iran, for example.

**PREFERENCES (preferred, but not required):**

* A contemporary/urban setting/period (can be based on our world or a fantastical one)
* Great world-building
* Political Intrigue (preferably of a geopolitical nature)
* Multiple players, entities, factions, etc.
* Large cast of characters
* A bit of wholesome romance

**SHOULD NOT CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING:**

* LGBTQ+ themes, characters, etc.
* Love triangles (or any sort of '*romantic*' drama that involves our main characters intimately interacting with anyone other than their '*destined*' love interest)
* The sole main character being a female
* Romanticization or glorification of Western entities such as the following:
   * American, British, French and/or Israeli Administrations (i.e. past or present)
   * CIA, MI6, MOSSAD, FBI, etc.

Ideally books that focus more on information dissemination (what is happening) and explanations (why, how, and maybe a bit of pros and cons) rather than taking positions (&amp;#39;fossil fuel is dead&amp;#39; / &amp;#39;why all pharma companies are bad&amp;#39; etc). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to ask questions. Many thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I think what draws me to fantasy is the adventure and escapism. If it helps, here are some of my favorite fantasy books:

* Percy Jackson and Harry Potter, of course
* Lockwood and Co. series by Jonathan Stroud
* The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison
* The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss
* The Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster Bujold
* Howl's Moving Castle by Dianna Wynne Jones

Books from other genres I love: Pride and Prejudice, Anne of Green Gables series, and Castaways of the Flying Dutchman (Brian Jacques).

While I am open to basically anything, I'm trying to avoid anything that's too dark/gritty or angsty. I typically dislike dystopian and thrillers. Any suggestions are appreciated, but bonus points if there's a good audiobook version!

The stories I have truly liked are fantasy where the character has a focused goal, something the reader enjoys when the character achieves it. I know it sounds vague, but it is also kind of rare. Books where you cheer the main character on.

An example of a simple one: My Next Life as a Villainess. Such a simple plot. Character wakes up in her favorite computer game as the villainess of the plot. She strives to make friends and not die. Simple plot and enjoyable to read. She screws up and makes a fool of herself but achieves her goal.

Loved:

Skyward, Ascendance of a Bookworm, I'm a Spider So What, Spice and Wolf, Stormlight Archive, Dresden Files, Full Metal Alchemist

Series I liked but not exactly what I enjoy. If anyone has additional series like the ones listed below I will try them out (I am desperate for new series), but they are not exactly my cup-of-tea:

Expanse series, Red Rising, Fitz and the Fool, Mistborn, Furies of Calderon, Cryptonomicron, Anathem, Baroque cycle, Kingkiller Cornicles, Snow Crash, Wheel of Time, Forever War, Saga of Tanya the Evil

I absolutely loved Wizards First Rule series when I was in high school. A friend went through it recently and, as I do/did, absolutely love the story and world but loathe the author's voice and imposed economic view. Going through it now it is like pulling teeth. I loathe it now more than any other series I have ever read because I loved it at one time.

Younger me did go through the Diskworld novels. I find them difficult to read now; somewhat aggravating to read. I love the world and novels, but maybe I just can't stand the wit of Terry Ratchet anymore due to damage from other authors.

&amp;#x200B;

From the fantasy series I have read, Song of Ice and Fire would be the logical next choice but I want something uplifting and have been told it is anything but.

I think her name was different. It could have been for a boy or a girl and not a common name &lt;em&gt;at that time&lt;/em&gt;
The book was about rebellious teens. Meaning drug and alcohol use, partying, boys, sex etc. 
The main character was a young teen girl. I believe she has a sister and her sister was the good child and “perfect” while the main character was struggling with mental health and ptsd symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about it. I know it’s not a lot but that’s one of two books I read around that time and if I could just find the title of one of them I’d be so happy. I’m sorry if this post isn’t allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

These are all the books on my TBR I haven't read yet. Which should I read next?

,booksuggestions,"Hi! 

So through a series of very fortunate events (including finding a long-lost brother!), I now have a 9 year old Asian-American niece (She's Thai and Filipino). I'm basically wonderbread white and loved reading the classic books as a child. From The Three Musketeers to Anne of Greene Gables, I devoured any book that I could get my hands on. But - as is well documented elsewhere - this classic literature has basically no representation. Even the series I read as a young child, like Junie B. Jones, Magic Tree House, and Boxcar Children featured white protagonists and only the occasional non-white side characters. These books have value - and I love the morals that they taught, the adventures that I went on through them, and the more or less guaranteed happily ever after. I will be sharing them with my niece. 

But I also want her to read stories that feature people that look like her. And while the stories that either focus on race or heavily feature certain experiences (for example, google keeps bringing me to stories about dumplings) are also on the list, those stories won't provide escapism. I want stories about a little dark skinned girl who wakes up and decides to time travel, or just lives life, but where race isn't the focus. Books that are like the classics that I used to read (and historical-fiction is great too), but aren't so white. **Think if the Netflix version of Bridgerton were rated G.** I promise that we aren't doing the colorblind thing - it's an important part of her identity and I have no desire to erase or ignore her heritage and the things she will experience in life as a part of that. But I want to provide her with the same kind of escapism that the classics were and are for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you guys provide suggestions?

These are the criteria:

1) 4th grade reading level or above

2) Lead is at least nonwhite (asian or asian american preferred)

3) Ethnicity and race are not the focus of the book

4) They are written in a similar style to classic children's literature (have clear morals, mostly happily ever afters, not romance focused).

Series would be great, but I will accept stand-alone novels. Genre is not important.

The male love interest has to be cheeky and mysterious to grab my attention. Teasing is always great!

I’m looking for books to get me back into reading. I know this will sound ridiculous, but NOTHING with a prologue. There is nothing I hate more than prologues. Also really good chapter 1’s that kick you off into the story; I unfortunately have such limited patience these days and getting through a couple books will help with that.

Books I like tend to be children’s fantasy and horror, but I am not exclusive to those and like lots of fiction.

Examples of what I’ve liked:

-Harry Potter (so easy to gobble up and amazing warm world/plots/characters. Not a complicated extreme fantasy)

-Bartimaeus Trilogy (narrative a bit tedious at times but otherwise awesome. Great funny main character)

-The Secret of Ventriloquism (Very intriguing horror anthology)

-Serpent of Venice (funny dialogue and brilliant main character who is a jester. I love jesters lol)

-The book that I thought I’d love and didn’t work for me was House of Leaves. I got a quarter in and stopped. Interesting plot moments were way too few and far between, and the book prides itself on being abusive which is fine, but not when I just want story sometimes.

Book or short story that shakes you to the core when a character realizes something shocking. Could be a revelation about really anything, something they just noticed now, a disturbing epiphany about someone they know, or a place, anything.

,booksuggestions,"Greetings, I hope you are all well.

I've been looking to get in to fiction recently, but I'm having a hard time identifying books that will suit my preferences. I'm quite the selective reader, actually.

I think almost any genre would be fine.

I would appreciate some recommendations!

&amp;#x200B;

**REQUIRED:**

* A setting based on, or loosely based on, West Asia, the Mediterranean, and/or East Europe. I wouldn't mind a Latin American setting either. It can be real or fantastical.
* The title can originally be written in any language so long as there is an officially licensed/published English version available.

&amp;#x200B;

**PREFERENCES (*****preferred, but not required)*****:**

* A contemporary/urban setting/period (can be based on our world or a fantastical one)
* Great world-building
* Political Intrigue (preferably of a geopolitical nature)
* Multiple players, entities, factions, etc.
* Large cast of characters
* A bit of wholesome romance
* A sense of adventure or wonder

&amp;#x200B;

**SHOULD NOT CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING:**

* LGBTQ+ themes, characters, etc.
* Love triangles (or any sort of '*romantic*' drama that involves our main characters intimately interacting with anyone other than their '*destined*' love interest)
* The sole main character being a female (I may be willing to compromise here, actually)
* Sex, whether explicit or implied
* Setting that takes place largely in outer space
* Romanticization or glorification of Western entities such as the following:
   * American, British, French and/or Israeli Administrations (i.e. past or present)
   * CIA, MI6, MOSSAD, FBI, etc.
* Religion(s) based on real-world religions, even if loosely based (I'm willing to compromise on this so long as the religions being represented are given fair treatment, and criticism, if any, is directed against people abusing their positions or power/influence than against the religion or ideology itself)
* Grimdark setting, or anything too 'edgy'
* A magic system, if present (though not preferred), that isn't dictated by clearly defined in-universe rules

I will assume any title recommended to me that belongs to a series will match my preferences throughout the entirety of the series and not just the title recommended.

At the moment, all I've got is the *Dune* series by Frank Herbert and his son Brian Herbert, though I'm not entirely sure if it will be for me.

,booksuggestions,"Apologies, as I know this has probably been asked before, but search didn't turn up anything interesting.

I'm looking for something weird, different, off the beaten path. It could be light or dark, happy ending or not, but ideally it'd be novel length. Any gender/sex or combination thereof is fine. The only thing I'm really not okay with is non-con, it can be discussed or even described but having it as fantasy is not okay. While I'm not particularly fond of historical fiction, I can make exceptions if it's well written.

A few things I liked:

* *Kushiel's Dart - Jacqueline Carey* \-- plan to go back to the series at some point.
* *Tortured Whispers - Danielle James*
* *Shards of Honour &amp; Barrayar - Lois McMaster Bujold*
* *The Star are Legion - Kameron Hurley* \-- this one blew my mind.
* *The Number of the Beast - Robert A. Heinlein* \-- not sure if this qualifies as romance even, but it was strange and fun.
* *Dark Horse/Deeds/Minds - Michelle Diener* \-- found it kind of trashy and predictable but still enjoyed.

Random ideas I'd enjoy reading about:

* Sci-fi hermaphroditic throuple
* Free love hippie commune, their adventures and crazy trips
* Whimsical magic brothel

-Chitra Banerjee Divakurni has written the book “An enchantment of forest” which retells Ramayana from the pov of Sita (wife of Ram). -
-Devdutt Patnaik is also a popular Hindu mythology author but I haven’t read his work.

-“Palace of illusions” by Chitra Banerjee Divakurni tells the story of Mahabharat from Draupadi’s (female lead) POV.

&lt;p&gt;Genre fiction is preferable. Horror doubly so. And you can google better writers than I will ever be to eloquently answer the question of why, but don’t anyone dare say JD Vance.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm the kind of person that uses books &amp; movies as an outlet to work through my own struggles &amp; I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that one of my close relatives probably abused me when I was young &amp; still has abusive tendencies with the people around him.

They hate each other yet they enjoy each other&amp;#39;s company, practically obsessed with the other person and continously desires their attention/ acknowledgement but no desire to pursue a romantic relationship. Or they can have a romantic relationship being hinted at or confirmed later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know classic literature like 19th century books tend to share similar themesor dark academia so I&amp;#39;m open to those as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Several years ago I was in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program back in high school. We dedicated an entire 4 months of our 2 year/4 semester program to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we also gave just as much time to the Iranian revolution. We read a few books that I can't seem to remember, all were nonfiction or semi autobiographical. I used many for term papers but I can't seem to find my list. The one that I can remember reading in class is Persepolis. I remember being so fascinated by the personal account of the abrupt shift in culture. The author captivated me that to this day nearly 10 years later I still think about the book and the papers I wrote. 

Most recently I have read nonfiction education textbook style recounts of events but I am interested in learning more from someone's perspective or maybe someone on here has also had to do research papers and cited a book? 

I am also seeking similar structured books on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, another theme I have always been interested in (however I cannot recall any titles from our curriculum).

I find this then cheapens my argument and I can’t think as clearly. I’m just finding it a bit harder lately, not sure why. 

I want to learn how to keep my cool and be understanding and respectful of the opposite opinion even if I disagree with it strongly.

,booksuggestions," 

I'm going through a mindset shift and as always, look to books for guidance. I'm looking for ***contemporary fiction*** or memoir centered on characters with non-monogamous lifestyles. 

What I'm looking for:

* Myself and my experience (discovering polyamory, hoping to open up a marriage, navigating difficult situations therein) represented in contemporary fiction.

What I'm not looking for:

* Erotica (though sex scenes are fine, I don't want sex to be the central draw of the book)
* Non-fiction guides like The Ethical Slut
* Sci-fi/Fantasy (which is normally totally up my alley, but currently I need something more real-life, fewer aliens and magic)

There has to be some contemporary fiction about couples who tackle the ""open marriage"" question, right? :S

,booksuggestions,"Hi,

My girlfriend has moved up on her job level and now has to deal with significantly more people management and business management in general.

Although she’s got a fair acumen on both, it’s mostly derived from general (positive) experiences. I’m looking for books to help her learn some skills around emotional intelligence, people management and business management but she’s not very oriented towards highly technical books (she’s more of a romance book person).

I introduced her to “Who moved my cheese” by S. Johnson and she devoured the book in a couple hours.

I’m looking for follow up books that can introduce her to these topics, without going towards the “Freakinomics” type of book (which I love but which I don’t thinks she’s so attracted to). Same would go for HBR and most books I enjoy myself.
