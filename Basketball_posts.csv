* As of this post, we're reaching 82,500 subscribers

* The majority of the subreddit is composed of basketball questions and nba related posts

* The rest of the sub is composed of 6'4 15 year olds wondering if they can dunk (kidding but not really)

* Apart from trying to keep up with the growth of the sub and removing as many spam links as we can, our mod team has been too busy to improve it with new ideas on the creative side. (pretty much 99% of the credit goes to /u/Commandant1 in keeping this sub as clean as it is honestly)

### Looking for Moderators to Keep this subreddit going as well as to bring/implement new ideas

* Even with the spam removal and rules that we've tried to put in place, we can probably all agree that there are just way too many posts that are the same question/same topic over and over. We're looking for a moderator that has mod experience and can help with sub upkeep. That means: being able to manually remove spam links, and to be able to create rules that auto filter spam posts (determined by the mod team). We don't expect you to be on 24/7 but are looking for reddit-heavy users.

* Creativity: If you're creative and have mod experience helping with design/look of a subreddit, please reach out to us. Shoutout to /u/theReluctantHipster for taking care of this in the past. We're looking for someone that has the creativity to come up with a new look for our logo, header, sidebar, etc. Really anything that can be changed is fair game.

Lebron, when asked when he started lifting, said 24 years old. Which means Lebron was a number 1 ranked high school football prospect and in the NBA at 18 years old 240 pounds overpowering grown ass men WITHOUT A SERIOUS WEIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM...

The fact that Lebron is still doing the same head over rim dunks and blocks, playing the Point Forward style at that size &amp; at the age of 36 without ever having a truly serious injury is unbelievable.

Meanwhile Jordan was damn near built like a shorter KD before he started lifting seriously because of the pistons (around 26-27.)

\[ Just wanna preface this by saying that I've been an athlete since my teens and been lifting weights seriously since I was in my early 20's. I've also been bodybuilding for about 5 years. So keep in mind that I'm a little more advanced that the average guy so I have a good foundation (Male, 29yo, 6'0"", \~210 lbs) \]

For about ten years, I've been trying to jump higher so I can dunk. I always tailored my leg training towards jumping higher and emulating basketball workouts. I kept trying but I never got there. It wasn't until I started studying the training of NFL athletes that the changes started coming. NFL players are absolute monsters. People might not realize that most Football players can run and jump as well (if not better) than NBA guys, and do so while being absolute slabs of muscle. NBA players work with lighter weights and do a lot of work on stability, and flexibility. Not saying NFL players don't do that too but it's not as much of a priority for them. They do a lot of heavy ass lifting including a lot of variations of compound lifts like squats, deads, oly lifts, etc.. Then incorporating that with explosive movement exercises like plyometrics and sprinting among other things. I've lifted heavy for legs before but not specifically like that.

So I thought, hey, those NFL guys are super athletic and jacked as hell, which is my goal. Why not train like them? So for about 4 months I trained like them and lo and behold, I was seeing steady monthly progress. My latest vert test had me at \~36""

Then recently I came upon a basketball court in a condo complex. This is the first time I've been able to use a basketball rim in months. So just to try it out I started testing my jump with it. I was so freaking shocked how easy getting up there had become. I was getting my wrist over the rim from a standing jump and with a running start, I could get my mid-forearm over the rim. I borrowed some kids ball and was able to dunk it no problem. So for those who've been struggling to jump higher and get up, I recommend looking into NFL or maybe even Rugby style training to get you there. You'll get bigger, stronger, and faster.

I'll share my program down below so you have an idea of what I did. Of course you don't have to do exactly what I did, but you can incorporate some of my stuff into whatever you're already doing. And also, I've been bulking for a few months which has helped me get stronger. So I advise you eat enough protein, carbs, and fat to get big and strong. But eat clean and try not to go overboard and get fat.

**WORKOUT SPLIT**: Push-Pull-Legs-Push-Pull-Legs-Rest (Upper body days are mostly bodybuilding oriented with heavy powerlifting type rep schemes for the big compounds) (I switch up the specific exercises every workout but the format is the same)(Variation = any exercise of that type)

**LEGS (POWER)**  
a. Dynamic warmup: warmup drills (like you're warming up for a football game)(5-10 min) , Tuck Jumps (3 sets @ 8 reps), Jump Rope (3 set @ 50 reps as fast as possible)  
b. Short Distance Sprints (Focus on acceleration rather than top speed)(3 sets @ 5-10 yards)  
c-d. Pick any 2 of these to do (Focus on being as explosive as you can, if your power output is lowering, stop and rest until the next set)  
\--Box Jumps (3 sets @ 4-5 reps)

f. Calf raises (3 sets @ 20-25) - Superset w/ any Abdominal Exercise (3 sets @ 12-15 reps)

**NOTES ON MY WORKOUTS**  
\-Sometimes I change the exercises if some equipment is being used or I feel like doing something else  
\-If you know how to properly (and safely) do Hang/Power Cleans, you can use that as a substitute for the Weighted Jump Variation or Power Day Squat Variation (I used to do them but I messed up my wrist and now I can't do it without pain)  
\-For the heavy back squats, you can use high or low bar. I use both depending on how I feel that day  
\-For all other squat variations aside from Heavy back squats, use high bar since it's more mechanically similar to a vertical jump",t2_ajkea,False,,0,False,"How I increased my vertical jump by NOT training like a basketball player (from 31"" to ~36"")",[],r/Basketball,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_m0306i,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},IMPROVING MY GAME,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615190262.0,text,6,,,text,self.Basketball,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Just wanna preface this by saying that I&amp;#39;ve been an athlete since my teens and been lifting weights seriously since I was in my early 20&amp;#39;s.

I am 6'2 (I'm 1/4 away from actually being 6'2)

Weight: 213

Wingspan: 6'5

My reach: 8 feet

Body Type: Tall and fat, but not too fat.... in between skinny fat and fat.

Current vertical: more than 2 feet (rough estimate, but I know it's a lil bit more than 2 feet. Probably 22-24 inches)

How did I measure my verticle? I had a measuring tape by my wall and I bent down and jumped up. I'm certain that I passed 2 feet.

I was thinking about dropping down from 213lbs to 190lbs and gain muscle, since I hardly have any. Focus on leg and try to increase my vertical by 1 foot.


Keep in mind that I don't have a proper jumping technique, so if I work on that, lose 23 pounds, and gain muscle. You think I'll have a shot at having a verticle of 3 feet? My goal is to dunk a ball on a 10 foot rim.

I run up to the rim on my tipitoes, plant both my feet planted flat on the ground, while squatting and throwing my hands behind my back, before releasing and myself like a spring at the rim.

With this method, I can only reach up to about halfway on the net.

When I do a layup, I barely even get up.

How can I make myself lighter and more springy on my feet? I want to get higher on my layups, but I don't really get up all that high.

Is there any exercises I can do with limited space (as the basketball court and my flat is quite small) to help me with jumping higher?

&lt;p&gt;This could be too much to ask for, but all the videos I watched to &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; with your technique help very little, if at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much if you take your time to respond to me.&lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball,"Canadians!!!

Upon the Raptors recent successes on the sport's biggest stage, I thought to myself, how could the country that invented basketball not have a league of its own? I then did some research and came across two leagues, the CEBL and the NBLC, which, once combined, could form a 15 team respectable league. It could be Canada's top flight, drafting both Canadian university graduates but also players from around the world. 

I've realized that there are tensions between the front offices of each team, however I think the potential benefits of a merger could far outweigh any sort of friction between owners. I created a structure combining both leagues that I think will create bitter rivalries and draw attention from coast to coast:

Even though their teams cover different regions of the country, there is still a potential for fierce rivalries to be built (between the NBLC's KW titans and the CEBL's Guelph Nighthawks for example). When comparing teams of both leagues and their facilities, there really isn't a glaring disparity (all stadiums fit at least 4,000 fans). The time of the year at which the leagues take place may be different, but I think a summer schedule would be better as it's the NBA's offseason and also gives players from European leagues to get some playing time in between their seasons.

A 3 conference structure seemed best for me, arranged as following:

|Atlantic Division:|Great Lakes Division:|Pacific Division:|
|:-|:-|:-|
|St John's Edge (NBLC)|Guelph Nighthawks  (CEBL)|Saskatoon Rattlers (CEBL)|
|Island Storm (NBLC)|Niagara River Lions  (CEBL)|Edmonton Stingers (CEBL)|
|Halifax Hurricanes (NBLC)|Hamilton Honey Badgers (CEBL)|Fraser Vally Bandits (CEBL)|
|Moncton Magic (NBLC)|Kitchener-Waterloo Titans (NBLC)|Sudbury Five (NBLC)|
|Ottawa Blackjacks (CEBL)|London Lightning (NBLC)|Windsor Express (NBLC)|

Over the regular season, teams will play others in the same conference 3 times and others twice, for a total of 32 games. This is down from the NBLC's usual 40 but up from the CEBL's regular 20. As a plus, this will only flare up the already existing rivalries between cities in similar divisions.

The playoffs will combine everything NBA fans have longed for; a play-in wild card tournament and reseed teams before the playoffs like March Madness. The top 2 teams in each conference qualify automatically, earning seeds 1-6 depending on their record and strength of schedule. The following 4 teams in terms of record will enter a single-elimination play-in tournament, with the finalists taking the last two wild card spots. The winner of the play-in tournament gets the 7 seed and the loser the 8th seed.

The rest of the playoffs go as normal; the 1 seed plays the 8 seed, the 2 seed with the 7, 3 vs 6, and 4 vs 5. Each round will be a best-of-5 series, with the higher seed hosting games 1,2 and 5 (if necessary).

For those who don't think this could happen, remember that the NBA originated from a merger between itself and the ABA. The same goes for the NFL and MLB. To me, it seems like the only thing stopping this merger would be the heads of each league not wanting to collaborate.

I need help to improve my gameplay on court.

The uncalled fouls are :

* Using shoulder and elbow when dribling to push the defensive player on offense (whole body)
* Using elbow after pick a rebound or when (offball) guard on defense
* When we drive, their hand will always try to hit the ball even hit our hands (not just hands up)
* When we drive and pullup (jump shot or layup), their body will enter our zone and hit our body

,Basketball," Would post on the vertical jump community, but no one has uses it regularly like this one so.

I have a 25 inch vertical from a 7 foot approach and I’m 14. I’ve been pretty athletic my whole life but I’m not the most gifted so I had to work really hard to get to where I am. 

I gained 6 inches in 1 year from when I was 13. My legs aren’t really that developed, but I do have 1 little vein showing on my calf though.

,Basketball,"Hello all,

I have a very specific situation and I am at a bit of a loss. I have a recreational player's and big fan's level of understanding of basketball. I do not have a coaches level of understanding. I have a situation in which I have to beat an objectively bigger, better and more athletic team in one game. And they definitely know they are better.

My team is not bad and we win a lot. We rely on stifling, tight d to create frustration. The frustration usually forces bad shots and turnovers, and we will leave poor shooters open at range to force them to take shots they do not have the ability to make at a decent rate. Our offense is reliant on transition and odd number breaks. Outside of the transition game, we put a huge emphasis on avoiding bad shots and limiting turnovers (basically, we play smart and force the other team to play dumb). We do not play very good half court offense, we usually do not have to. We also lack the ball handling of better teams. We usually blow out most teams, but I can see they have the talent to overcome what we do. 

That being said, the option of slowing down the game seems like it is not much of an option for us. Does anyone have any suggestions?

,Basketball,"About me:5’10, 140, long wingspan, long legs, short torso, pretty slow, decent 3 point shot

Yo, my sophomore season just ended and I didn’t really play much. When I did play my coach played me at pf when I should really be a guard which is why I need to work on my guard skills. The varsity team for my hs is pretty good and has good guards so if I want to make the team I really have to improve

Basketball wise: I have a decent mid range/3 point shot, my ball handling is ok but it’s not up to par and needs to get a lot better for varsity, my defense is pretty good but I’m slower and get blown by sometimes, I’m very good at passing and my iq/instincts are really good defensively and offensively. 

Physically:Like I said I’m 5’10, 140 lbs, and I have long legs and a long wingspan and a short torso. I’m pretty weak due to my longer arms and legs so I need to get those stronger and I need to get faster and more explosive. My core isn’t strong either.

&lt;p&gt;Yo, my sophomore season just ended and I didn’t really play much. When I did play my coach played me at pf when I should really be a guard which is why I need to work on my guard skills. The varsity team for my hs is pretty good and has good guards so if I want to make the team I really have to improve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basketball wise: I have a decent mid range/3 point shot, my ball handling is ok but it’s not up to par and needs to get a lot better for varsity, my defense is pretty good but I’m slower and get blown by sometimes, I’m very good at passing and my iq/instincts are really good defensively and offensively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physically:Like I said I’m 5’10, 140 lbs, and I have long legs and a long wingspan and a short torso. I’m pretty weak due to my longer arms and legs so I need to get those stronger and I need to get faster and more explosive. My core isn’t strong either. My cardio/stamina isn’t the best and I get gassed quickly. Also I can grab rim but I want to be able to dunk.&lt;/p&gt;

I know this isn’t a doctors group and people may not care but I was wondering how many calories should I be eating a day in order to increase my chances of growing in height. I’m 5”9 and 77kg around a 14/15% body fat and I’m 16 years old, I’m  currently eating around 2500/3000 calories a day but also  burning around 1300/1500 through training basketball throughout the day as I train for around 5/6 hours a day as well as vertical training at night. 

Does me burning these calories mean I should also try-eat them if I want to increase my chance of growing. I don’t have a diet per say but I do track the foods I eat and I eat around 130g of protein 60/70g of fat and 300/330g of carbs daily.

,Basketball,"Hey y'all!

I'm shopping for new hoop shoes for the first time in a while and wanted some input. These are exclusively for playing in and have to stand up to some serious outdoor play.

For reference I am 5'9"" 160 lbs. The last two shoes I've hooped in are Jordan 29s and Kyrie 2s. Love both of them, still wear the 29s even though they're torn to shreds. 

I'm looking for stability/responsiveness - would describe myself as a playmaking combo guard - lots of eurostepping and quick pivots. I would grab the new low Kyries in a heartbeat but unfortunately I have a reconstructed knee that needs more support.

So, new Lebrons? Zoom Freaks? Lebron Witness? Is there an Adidas shoe I should look at?

,Basketball,"My roommate is an in-shape, 26-year-old male measuring 5’-10”, weighing \~180 Ibs, who was a decent high school basketball player and continues to play pickup on a semi-regular basis. His skill is equivalent to a below average Division III player. While watching some recent NBA games, I complimented a shot that was made over a defender, to which my roommate responded that he could have made that shot. The conversation escalated and turned into a full out debate about the gap between the best basketball player in the world and a decent high school athlete.

The conversation ended with him stating, with complete conviction, that if you give him 100 opportunities to score against Lebron James, with Lebron trying his absolute hardest on defense, my roommate could score at least 1 basket. Our friend group is completely torn and I was curious what everyone else thinks.

Rules: Ball is checked up from the free throw line, every shooting foul my roommate gets another 2 possessions. There is a one-minute shot clock, normal out of bounds/half-court violation rules apply. Opportunities are defined as a change in possession. There is only one-shot attempt per possession, so if there is a missed shot or a shot is blocked it ends the possession. When we say Lebron is trying his hardest, think something along the lines of him getting fined or being forced to retire if my roommate makes a single shot, AKA he would not give up any “freebies”.

Is a shoe circuit aau program the best way to go? (EYBL, Adidas Gauntlet, UAA) We actually DON’T have an active EYBL team, so It’s between Adidas and UA.

&lt;p&gt;Is a shoe circuit aau program the best way to go? (EYBL, Adidas Gauntlet, UAA) We actually DON’T have an active EYBL team, so It’s between Adidas and UA. &lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball,"I’m 14 and still growing quickly, I usually play basketball at a 8 year old park 5 minutes away that really hurts my knees when I land because the ground is solid concrete. The fence is really low so when it hits off the rim it bounces off and into the boggy grass (really wet and clogged with water) and the ball gets all wet which affects my playing ability.

So here I am, asking for help seeing if I can get assistance with getting in touch with Agent Zero to take a look at this, and see if maybe he can help me out of course.

I got my jersey back in 2007 as part of an auction for charity Gilbert hosted and mentioned back in his blog he used to run during that time in the NBA on their site, and the sentimental value behind it is for me as a growing teen at the time Arenas' personality and way of just being himself was some of the best encouragement I had to be myself and I needed to have that growing up.

,Basketball,"Im looking to get better at being a roll man. For context I’m just playing pickup with friends but we are a bit more serious than average pickup but it’s still pickup. I understand how to set good screens and where to set them and all that. 

The things I want to improve on are 

my roll timing/speed based on how the defense is playing me.

Better techniques for catching the ball when the pass isn’t perfect.

Finishing from awkward spots.

For context I am 100% an undersized big. I’m usually 2-3 inches shorter than the person guarding me. I’m almost always faster and stronger. I can’t dunk, so lobs are not in my bag.
I draw help on most of my roles because I’m faster than opposing bigs. If my defender is smaller/quicker than me I just post up.

Usually the help comes from the corner on the left/opposite side, the wing defender usually cheats down to the elbow where he can cut off my guards pass to the corner, and because I’m shorter than my man I can’t throw a line drive to the corner, I have to throw it over my man which gets picked off about half the time.

How do I individually get better at beating my man, and how should I play against this type of PnR coverage?

I’m a freshman in high school, pretty skinny and 5’5”. Because of COVID, our school was having practices but players who were already practicing for other sports like football and baseball couldn’t practice with us. So we’ve been practicing for a few months at that point, but everything got shut down so there were no more practices. Of course I’m practicing by myself now too since we can’t practice as a team. Later we started conditioning again since we couldn’t do actual practices but everyone that wants to come can come. I’m always there going hard still. Which brings us to today. He said that we were going to start AAU so he had to cut some players so we had a single hour and a half day of tryouts. I was one of the only very few guys that remembered some of the plays not to mention the fact that I knew every single one. I guarantee you I am the only person there that had practiced the plays and gone over those plays even mentally at all. Some of those guys I feel like had an advantage because they knew the coaches because of their brothers which I have none, or because they played previously in 7th or 8th grade with them, but I still knew the plays better than them. We did some team shooting drills and I felt like I was one of the only ones on my team that could make a shot, but then again I don’t think coaches care that much about drills. We played a total of 10 minutes of 5 on 5, I airballed one shot, got hard fouled driving to the paint, made a layup, and played average defense using the shadow defense they had taught us during the short 5 on 5. In the end there would probably be realistically like 6 people competing for 3 spots since 12 were essentially locks and the rest had basically no chance. At the end of the tryout he had everyone come up to him individually. He told me that I didn’t make it. He said that I wasn’t up to par with the other PGs. I don’t know who made the team, but I know a few things: two of the 6 I am flat out better than, another one of them in my opinion I’m better but he has an older brother and he’s been in the program longer (he still didn’t know the plays and I tried to help lead him to the right spots on the plays, one of them isn’t good at basketball straight up but he is just big which I guess is something that you can’t teach but that really makes me mad, and one might’ve been better than me but I have no idea since he hadn’t came to any prior practices and I had been the only one to go to EVERY SINGLE PRACTICE. Our coach said that this is just for AAU, but to me it feels like at the real tryouts, which probably won’t even happen, they are already going to be so ahead with new plays and them literally playing together that they aren’t going to want anyone different or new to be on the team to possibly ruin that. I feel like I’ve wasted so much of my time working hard to get better everyday and I just lost everything, all of that, in one day, in a single hour. I have no idea what to do at this point. It feels like all I have left to do all day is gonna be school and this especially makes me feel worse because the only friends I ever talk to all went to the other high school after middle school.

,Basketball,"Ight, so for some context, I’m 5’7, 15, and my school, city is still in quarantine (Houston)

ok, so before quarantine or Corona started, (Jan-March 2020) I was a giant basketball enthusiast, and an average player who was passionate about the game, but could never afford a trainer, or AAU. I had kinda given up all hope because I know so many good players with scholarships, and never thought I could compete with them, until I was convinced by a few of my friends to lock in and actually take basketball really seriously. For like 3 months before Corona, we would try to find AAU teams, trainers, gyms etc. Finally we made a team, and literally grinded our butts off and improved so much, we were in the gym 4 times a week working and having more fun every day.

Then Corona hit..

my parents are super strict about quarantine rules, so so the beginning, I never left my neighborhood. I wasnt able to go to practice, and eventually our season got cancelled. Our grind streak was put on halt, which in my opinion really slowed down my progression. And to be honest, I got way out of shape, and way worse than I had probably ever been, Maybe 3 months into quarantine, after not playing basketball for months, I found DEVINTHELAB, Dvontay Friga, and Tesupreme (basketball youtubers) I fell completely in love with the game again, but this time, I was so serious. I ate, slept, and breathed basketball. I had film sessions by myself, got into better shape than ever, prayed about basketball, did workouts in my room etc. this went on to around August.

in august, my friend (who had basically been on the same journey as me, grinding trying to get better) and I decided to start a YouTube channel documenting us grinding, so that we could track our growth, and inspire others like us. My parents became more lenient about quarantine during this time, so we really pursued this. We invited a D1 prospect to the channel (important for later) and two other really good hoopers who were friends of ours

for 4 months, we were on the grind every weekend, getting so much better, and improving so much. I was so happy and anticipated the weekend so that I could go hoop with them and record. The thing was, I noticed that my friends were seriously blooming and surpassing me. Getting scholarships, getting invited to college runs, etc. once again, I began to get a pretty negative outlook on basketball, and quit completely. This was in October.   


it’s now Feb 2021, and I’ve touched a basketball 2 times since then. I want to play so bad, every time I watch the nba, or see highlights on YouTube, I just wanna go start that grind again, but I feel like I can’t. I don’t even know why. Maybe it’s because I’m  nervous  that I’ll never reach my full potential, idk. At this point, I’m way out of shape (at least by basketball standards ) and lacking motivation.

read some amazing comments on this thread (still new to reddit tho idk how to operate it quite yet)

  
i forgot to mention, i was in the varsity team for my high school for 3 years(2015-2018) i was 15 at the time, currently in college 2nd year, been working on my comeback because there are alot of competition here in the philippines, overall in highschool ive been pretty athletic i was 5'6 and 55kg and i could touch the rim (10ft fiba standard) but only on rare occasions or if i had a good warm up, I didnt care about my health ( joint health ) at the time i only started suffering in my senior year , I was a small forward in my junior year, and slowly progressed to shooting gaurd in my senior year because every time I slashed to the rim my knees would hinder me, that eventually turned me into a catch and shoot shooter.  


  
i would really like to improve and would like to compete in college ! I'm currently trying to make it a slow yet effective comeback on my athleticism ? i want to compete in college and be able to dunk ,its been a dream of mine personally. (i wouldn't want to progress fast because im an engineering student, work and academics can be a pain in the bum)  


 since the start of january of 2021 ive started weight training, first 2 weeks ive, started lifting with no weights i wanted to get my form correctly, then progressed with adding weight each week (i wouldnt say very heavy weight for me but safe enough for me to perform)

Its a strategy in entire soccer games for most players to mark the enemy team's top scorer even when another player on the enemy team ended up with the ball and its proven to be a successful one in the entire existence of soccer.

At this moment the pelicans are the 13 seed in the west while Houston is the 9 seed in the west. Both teams are good but the rockets are clearly the better team at the moment led by Wood’s amazing play. Wood is averaging 22 points a game with 10 rebounds and 1 and a half assists. He is shooting 56 percent from the field and 42 percent from 3 with 1 steal and 1 and a half blocks. Zion is putting up 23 points a game with 7 rebounds and 2 and a half assists. He is shooting 59 percent from the field and 36 percent from 3 with 1 steal and 1 block a game. Their stats are pretty similar Zion is a better scorer and passer and a bit better from the field while Wood is a better shooter better rebounder and better defender.

Everyone knows that MVP Rose was one of the most exciting players to watch in the early 10's.

So, do you think that he could begin a dynasty in Chicago and win a few rings and become the best PG all time and arguably the goat?
Argument could be made that he relied on his athelicism and that would only decline every year, or he didn't have a consistent jumper or even that with his risky style of play it's a matter of time until an injury comes.
Chicago bulls with d rose, joakim Noah, Kyle korver and a big depth were close to a ring...

,Basketball,"I'm a 7th grader in middle school (I'm 13, chill out) and I recently tried out for the school basketball team. I didn't make it last year, and I failed this year. Compared to others, I feel like I'm inferior. I keep losing to the people I **know** I'm better than, and it sucks. 

For me, I'm jealous often. 7th graders who ***I'm better than*** made it, and they didn't do anything in scrimmages and drills. They took bad shots, only passed when they were double-teamed, and it honestly made me feel helpless when I was told I didn't make it. I was (and still am) just confused.

But now, I feel like I won't make it next year either because I already had my chances. I'm not the strongest, I'm not the fastest, I don't have the best cardio, I'm damn sure not the tallest (I'm 5'3), and I'm not the most intelligent. I just don't have a strong suit. I asked my coach what I needed to improve at, and they said I leave my feet too often, meaning I'll drive and then jump, realize I'm defended too well, and then pass out to my teammates and turn the ball over.

The problem with this and why I literally cannot fix it is that I've never played 5v5 with other people. I've always played by myself, and I've never, not once, played on any kind of sports team. The people living in my house are not athletic and don't care enough about my talent in basketball to help me, nor are they better than me. The only time I get to play with people is when friends come over, but that's once in a blue moon.

As I said, I'm 13 and I feel like I'm not going to improve more than the superior players are. Once again, I'm medium-sized at best, skinny, and I don't have a single good thing about my game other than my handles (which, to be frank, aren't very helpful in a scrimmage game at tryouts)

Everyone who's failed at tryouts has heard the ""Michael Jordan got cut from his basketball team in his sophomore year"" speech that has just been drained into cut players' minds so many times.

,Basketball,"I’m a freshman, 14, 6 foot, and super unathletic, so in august I started playing, ive been playing every single day for between 1-2 hours, but the only thing I really feel like I’ve gotten better at is my dribbling. I watch a lot of nba when I’m not playing, so I feel like my iq is good enough to play in a real game. My problem is that I feel like I need a coach to actually improve my game from here, because I know I have the work ethic to get really good it’s just that I need some guidance to figure out what I need to change, except I’m not good enough to make a team. My jumpshot is absolutely horrible, most of the time the ball will just bounce off the side of the rim, or bounce off the backboard to the left of right, not even touching the rim. I’ve watched a lot of videos trying to fix my shot but when I actually try to do what they tell me, it never works. I feel like I don’t really have a good grip on the ball when I shoot, and it just kinda slips around. When I do make it, it almost always goes in off the glass.

I watch a lot of nba when I’m not playing, so I feel like my iq is good enough to play in a real game. My problem is that I feel like I need a coach to actually improve my game from here, because I know I have the work ethic to get really good it’s just that I need some guidance to figure out what I need to change, except I’m not good enough to make a team. My jumpshot is absolutely horrible, most of the time the ball will just bounce off the side of the rim, or bounce off the backboard to the left of right, not even touching the rim. I’ve watched a lot of videos trying to fix my shot but when I actually try to do what they tell me, it never works. I feel like I don’t really have a good grip on the ball when I shoot, and it just kinda slips around. When I do make it, it almost always goes in off the glass.

,Basketball,"For as long as I can remember, I've played basketball. My father introduced me to it when I was very young. I loved the sport and would constantly play whenever I could get my hands on a ball. But after constantly doing something, like all things, you get sick of it.

I have played every year of my life since I was 5. And a part of me doesn't want to let it go for the sake of nostalgia, and just nostalgia. I am also scared to confront my parents about it. They aren't crazy, I'm just not a very confrontational person.

Over the years, I've gotten very good, with the help of my height of course. I am 6 feet 6 inches tall. Some would say its wasted potential if I quit. That's another reason why I'm feel like I am obligated to keep playing, because other kids would kill to have my height. Now, going into my sophomore season, I want to quit.

Truth is, I am sick of it. All of it. The practices everyday, the feeling like I don't belong there, the lack of passion I have for the sport, the sprints, and the amount of time it takes up. I've recently gotten into lifting. Me and my friends go everyday and we all love it. I also do cardio there and have stayed in shape in the offseason. I have put on a substantial amount of weight, most being muscle. I have seens muscular gain all over my body and have hit personal records. I love everything about it.

I don't know if I should quit basketball and just lift weights and play volleyball, a sport I like a lot more. I see basketball as a chore and it's just not as fun as it used to be. What do you think I should do?

,Basketball,"tldr/ my 8yo daughter has a fascination with basketball even though we’re not a “basketball” household how do I nurture that to be what she needs it to be and not “all about me and my ideas about it” what did you need concerning basketball when you were 8yo


Over the past few years my 8yo daughter has mentioned/ questioned my experience in high school basketball and my wife’s experience in high school basketball (we both played HS then never really played after that) It’s a reoccurring topic for my 8yo. She has this 20” kick ball from Walmart that she bounces through the house regularly and wants to talk about basketball. We aren’t a basketball household (Tom Brady is the only sports that gets talked about here) and her interest in basketball always surprises me. 

She recently said that we need a favorite NBA and WNBA team and asked if we have a team in Georgia which is where we live. How did she even hear about the WNBA? Mind blown. 

As a dad, I recognize this is “GO TIME” for me. My urge is to go nuts over basketball with her, the whole culture- jerseys, shoes, watching games, balls and equipment, renting court time, professional trainers, saving money so I can buy her game time paying off the jr high coach, donating to my local Div 1 program for some preferential treatment later down the road...

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years my 8yo daughter has mentioned/ questioned my experience in high school basketball and my wife’s experience in high school basketball (we both played HS then never really played after that) It’s a reoccurring topic for my 8yo. She has this 20” kick ball from Walmart that she bounces through the house regularly and wants to talk about basketball. We aren’t a basketball household (Tom Brady is the only sports that gets talked about here) and her interest in basketball always surprises me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She recently said that we need a favorite NBA and WNBA team and asked if we have a team in Georgia which is where we live. How did she even hear about the WNBA? Mind blown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a dad, I recognize this is “GO TIME” for me. My urge is to go nuts over basketball with her, the whole culture- jerseys, shoes, watching games, balls and equipment, renting court time, professional trainers, saving money so I can buy her game time paying off the jr high coach, donating to my local Div 1 program for some preferential treatment later down the road... I could really get into this. s/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really though. I’m all in. She obviously has a natural fascination in the game of hoops and the time has come for me to nurture her relationship with basketball. &lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball,"I (28, M) recently tore my ACL and am having a hard time deciding which is the best type of surgical procedure given my style of play and morphological characteristics. 

At 5'8, I rely heavily on my lateral quickness and explosivity and have a poor vertical jump in part due to my clubfoot which have undergone two surgical procedures significantly limiting the range of motion of my ankle and strength of peroneal and calf muscles. 

Each of the three orthopedic surgeons which I consulted suggested a different surgical procedure (Kenneth-Jones, DT4, and MAC FL). The surgeon who suggested MAC FL (quadriceps autograft) claims that it is the best procedure for me given that I have joint hyperlaxity. The other two surgeons told me there is no significant difference in post-operative recovery between Kenneth-Jones (patellar autograft) and DT4 (hamstring autograft), but neither mentioned potential advantages or disadvantages in regards to basketball, clubfoot, or joint hyperlaxity. 

Finally, physiotherapist ""A"" advised me against the MAC FL, because it would apparently weaken my stabilizers which he claims allows me compensate for limitations related to my clubfoot. Physiotherapist ""B"" had reservations about Kenneth-Jones, as she is worried weakening my patellar tendon could further hinder my jumping ability. Physiotherapist ""C"" strongly advised me to do the Kenneth Jones. He had a DIDT (older version of the DT4) which caused permanent and untreatable damage to his hamstring tendon, and cut short his rugby career. He also says MAC FL is trash.

This is why lots of girls struggle in sports.

,Basketball,"Hi! So I have a lot of basketball experience by playing pickup for years, but I've actually never played on an organized team. So I have a few questions about the process of being on a highschool basketball team (particularly in the US).

My main question: How do tournaments work? I figure this might differ from state to state, but just tell me how it worked where you played. Does every team in your region get into the tournament? Do you have to win a certain number of games in the regular season to get into it? Do some smaller schools not even play in tournaments? If you win or place well in your local tournament do you move on to bigger regional or state-wide tournaments? What's the upper limit? Is the state-wide tournament the highest level in high school, or do the teams who win the state-wide tournament move on to play the best teams from other states?

Any other details you can tell me about the process of seeding and how tournaments work would be greatly appreciated! I'm especially curious about small schools. Would it be possible for even a very small school to make it to the state-wide tournament if they suddenly became good enough? Or do only bigger schools even get access to those tournaments?

I came in and put some cracking skin cream on them. They got better for that day but noticed them cracking more and keep putting the cream on them. I kept playing for about 20 days and they were terrible only on the outside they weren’t really bad on the inside at that point I stopped playing they healed as I took a break for probably 5 days. Then I decided to go to the dermatologist the doctor said he didn’t think it was the concrete because how straight the lines were on my wrists between where it stops and starts around my wrist. He said it was probably some soap or something I used washing my hands. I’m sure the guy knows how to do his job but for all of this to started within 15 minutes of me playing on it seems like a dead giveaway to me. So after what he said I started playing again. They still were cracking. So we put sealant on it which we thought would seal away what ever was in it hurting my hands. (I played basketball on hard word and gravel and it never bothered my hands or skin) we put 3 thin coats of the sealant on like the instructions said. The concrete also has fibers in it. After the sealant dried I went back to playing. While it doesn’t seem as bad on my hands it’s still bad especially on my fingers. I have tried about 6 different basketballs on it leather and rubber and putting Vaseline, 2 prescription medicine creams, ( also putting the prescription medicine on and then sleeping in gloves with the medicine on) lotion that the dermatologist gave me and soap the dermatologist gave me also cracking cream.

,Basketball,"Hey Reddit, I have a young 12 yr old player who needs honest advice. 

Unfortunately, the young man does not value my opinion enough (he thinks I am trying to make him better). 

So he agreed to listen to the advice of random people on the internet (just typing that makes me realize how different our generations are). 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the situation-short and too the point:

He is a very talented basketball player in terms of athletic ability and raw skill. BUT he has low bball IQ  (really bad at plays and can get confused during games when faced with defense that is beyond simple man). 

He made the decision to join on of the better AAU teams in his region, because yeah he loved the fact that they win all the time. 

But he is now in a situation where he now sits on the bench and gets very little playing time.

The team is winning but he contributes very little to the actual game. 

***He wants to know ""is there value to being on the bench on a wining team (Team A) vs getting the chance to put up tons of stats on a bad team (Team B)?""***

What is the better experience to help him learn the fundamentals of the game---

I would greatly appreciate it ya could share your thoughts or advice for how he can get through the season.

,Basketball,"This is a story from Clutch Points

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, there’s some good news for the Brooklyn Nets as superstar Kevin Durant is expected to be available against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday. However, it’s still unclear if the other half of the 7-11 duo, Kyrie Irving, will also return from his mysterious hiatus.

 Durant was initially supposed to just sit out versus the Utah Jazz due to possible exposure with COVID-19, but the team elected to sit him out for the rest of the week. The two-time NBA champion has missed Brooklyn’s last three games, with the team going 2-1 in his absence.

 Kyrie Irving, meanwhile, has missed the last two games after suddenly opting not to play against the Philadelphia 76ers. The six-time All-Star also did not join the rest of the team in their road game against the Memphis Grizzlies.

The Nets, on the other hand, have struggled without their two players and currently hold a 5-5 win-loss slate. They got outplayed by the Grizzlies in their last outing on Friday, 115-110. Caris LeVert did his best to make up for the pair’s absence by dropping 43 points on 15-for-23 shooting from the field and 7-of-9 from downtown, along with five boards and six assists in 36 minutes.

Still, it’s quite clear the Steve Nash-mentored team won’t get too far unless Durant and Irving can consistently play games together. While KD’s probable return is a good start, the Nets brass must still sort out Irving’s situation.",t2_7v3zege3,False,,0,False,Kevin Durant probably returning for Nets vs. Thunder with Kyrie Irving now questionable to play,[],r/Basketball,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_kufeub,False,dark,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1610317858.0,text,6,,,text,self.Basketball,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story from Clutch Points&lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball,"Hello everyone 

I'd like to embrace this great community focusing on our passion, the sport that we love.

To get straight to the point, as you can see from my tittle, I have a question about the way ( at least in my case ) I play/used to play between the past ( when I was teenager, around 14-17 years old for example ) and now ( that I'm 27 ). Moreover I need to mention here that after 18 years old I stopped playing basketball and started over again at like 24. 

To be more specific I'm talking about the **inspiration** I had during gameplay which now isn't the same at all. I feel like I could see wider on the pitch. I feel like I could execute moves without thinking about them first, unlike how I do it now in most cases. It was something that could happen **spontaneously**, if that makes sense. I feel like I could actually execute a move or do something on the pitch but at the same time I could also focus on something else on the game ( for example an assist or something ) and not just when making a move to be 'absorbed' on it and forget/don't see what else is happening, which happens sometimes now. I'm giving you some examples so you can understand what I mean.

I was never a pro player or somebody who used to train everyday or played in a great team. I just had the ability to play decent in a local league level/tournaments/outdoors/school etc. mainly because I knew how to move or play smart, not because of my body but because of the '**mind**' game or 'brain' game if that makes sense. Not sure if the physical condition/more energy of the younger age plays a role. 

I still haven't figured the exact reasons or maybe I'm making assumptions for the possible causes. What I assume it's happening is that our brain 'operates' different in different ages but I also think all that happened because I didn't keep playing ( all those years that I was off ) to maintain that ability. 

I'm sure there is an explanation but I'm asking for your opinion/help about it because it's something I want to find out/work on it since I really miss the way I used to play and perform. It kind of feels 'unfair' to know how better you were able to play ( without any special training or work at all ) and now not being able to stay close to this kind. Do you think it's something that can be acquired again? Do you think the more practice/gameplay experience will bring back this ability? Would you say other life factors play role?

,Basketball,"Hello, I've been watching basketball for a long time but I never understood how could defenders can't stop threes. I tried to search about this but it seems that answer is so obvious that people don't even ask this question. I need a detailed technical answer.

For example. You have a guy starting to shoot a three, what happens if you hit directly to the ball with your arm or get so close to the player that he can't even jump, pull or shoot. Would you not do this without fouling?

Or assume you are a guy who has amazing vertical, can't you block every 3 shot by jumping in front of the player?

Whenever I watch a 3 happen in NBA it looks like to me defender does not try enough (I know it's not like that.)

I didn't play much ball so I don't know how the true mechanics or speed of the game work. I guess that in an NBA game these things happens so fast. (Not like on TV).

,Basketball," 

Paul Westphal, a Hall of Fame player who won a championship with the Boston Celtics in 1974 and later coached in the league and in college, died Saturday. He was 70.

He died in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a statement from Southern California, where Westphal starred in college. He was diagnosed with brain cancer last August.

A five-time All-Star guard, Westphal played in the NBA from 1972-84. After winning a championship with the Celtics, he made the finals in 1976 with Phoenix, where he was a key part of one of the most riveting games in league history. He also played for Seattle and the New York Knicks.

He averaged 15.6 points, 4.4 assists and 1.9 rebounds during his career.

After his playing career ended, Westphal moved into coaching. He led the Suns to the NBA Finals in 1993, and also was head coach of Seattle and Sacramento. He had stints as an assistant with Dallas and Brooklyn.

“There may be just a handful of people who have as much influence and significance on the history of the Phoenix Suns,” former team owner Jerry Colangelo said. “All he accomplished as a player and as a coach. Off the court, he was a gentleman, a family man, great moral character. He represented the Suns the way you want every player to represent your franchise.”",t2_8qk903tu,False,,0,False,Hall of Famer Paul Westphal dies at 70.,[],r/Basketball,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_kpzsa2,False,dark,0.81,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},NBA,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1609758480.0,text,6,,,text,self.Basketball,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Westphal, a Hall of Fame player who won a championship with the Boston Celtics in 1974 and later coached in the league and in college, died Saturday.

**The Rules:**

1.) The character must be from a live-action movie.  
So no animation, sorry *Space Jam* Lola Bunny or Brave Little Toaster.

2.) No powers, no magic, etc.

3.) Biopics are fine, but no athletes playing themselves.  
You could take Boobie Miles from Friday Night Lights, but not LeBron in Trainwreck.  
*Important note: players playing other people are fair game. That’s half the fun.  But you are getting the character, not the actor.*

No Ents from Lord of the Rings, even if they’d be dominant in the post.

,Basketball,"I am gonna explain my situation, i am a 20 year old dude, i play ball since 2 years, and i am currently playing in the lowest league of switzerland, the level is really really low, every D1 kid could drop 45 a game on this level i am not joking. 

First off i am taking this somewhat serious because i find the thought about looking like a demigod and carrying my team to wins and helping us absolut nice. To be honest this shit doesnt matter in the big picture (but i still want it) because i cant make the pros because i started to late, and i dont have godlike genetics nor talent.

So what is the problem? I would say for the league i am like a 6'11-7feet dude in nba terms, if you face a 6'6 dude thats pretty tall, average center height is like 6'4-6'5 so i have the height, i am not undersized. If that matters.

What about my current kit? I am a very good rebounder for the league, i dominate in that term, most points i get by putbacks. I have also very big hands. 

I would say i am a walmart tristan thompson without the post moves. 

I am ""normal"" athletic, max vert around 28' inch and i can only do 1 handed dunks, with a running start.

So my question is in which attribute can you get the most value in low league play.

Tbh i thought about focusing on my athleticism mostly because

- better rebounder (damn i would be so much better then the competition in this league) 
- lob threat, opens up some plays
- shoot blocking force (the league doesnt have much shooters, so there are many many drives) 

I also thought to focus on finishing around the rim, to be able to finish in all positions.

Can someone create me a simple trainingsplan? Which attribute to train which day? Just a simple

Monday this, tuesday this etc

This sounds funny but i just wanna help my team win i dont care if i ""chess"" the system and just improve in things which are very overpowered in low league play.

Very strong rebounder for my size, and I’ll usually initiate the offense. That’s how my teammates prefer it since I have very crisp passing and vision. My offensive skills are very narrow though. I’ve developed a good fadeaway jumper and midrange shooting. I’ll occasionally hit a three if I’m feeling good but I can’t get it consistently. My ball handling is fair, it’s usually enough to get by most bad and average defenders, but better defenders give me trouble. My footwork is very polished since I played soccer at a younger age.

&lt;p&gt;In my area 5’11 is pretty tall for my age, but there are a few guys that would reach 6 feet and taller (I’m still growing mind you, so I’ll probably end up being 6-foot+) I’ll generally play the 3/sf or 4/pf, sometimes running the 5/c when no one taller is available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a bit athletic (33 inch max vert), having a bit of trouble dunking on a 10-foot rim. My strengths are perimeter and inside defense, for I come up with a lot of steals and blocks. Very strong rebounder for my size, and I’ll usually initiate the offense. That’s how my teammates prefer it since I have very crisp passing and vision. My offensive skills are very narrow though. I’ve developed a good fadeaway jumper and midrange shooting. I’ll occasionally hit a three if I’m feeling good but I can’t get it consistently. My ball handling is fair, it’s usually enough to get by most bad and average defenders, but better defenders give me trouble. My footwork is very polished since I played soccer at a younger age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tips are obviously appreciated. I’ll be sure to read as much of your responses as I can. Have a good day people ✌️&lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball,"Before I start, I wanna say that I'm not ""short"" in terms of the worldwide general population at 6'0.5"" tall and 6'3"" wingspan. I'm also 18.

However, every time I open my Instagram or YouTube I see these freakishly tall kids who haven't even fully grown yet with their superhuman proportions and just lose all hope. How can I possibly compete with someone who has an ape index of +8in at PG? I feel like maybe basketball isn't my sport even though I've spent the majority of my quarantine, and greater part of my life learning and growing and getting stronger in order to succeed at it. The truth is that I'm afraid of not being able to perform when the time comes for me to play at the next level, and when my equivalent (position-wise) on the court is physically superior by a large margin.

Should I still pursue my basketball goals? I love this game, but if I am fundamentally disadvantaged, is it worth my time to keep going? I know this is a weird and kinda personal subject I'm asking about here but I don't have people in my life who I can talk to about this stuff with.

I’m 19 6ft3 barefoot 175lbs 6ft8 wingspan and a 40 inch vertical decently fast with good stamina but I’m also quick enough to blow by most people. my handles and shot could use a lot of work though. I have some post moves too but I’m not sure how much that’ll help. 

In terms on experience, I played 3 years of high school ball, but I played center/pf most of the time because I was the biggest on the team. 

I know it’s gonna take a lot so I’ve been training/hooping for 2ish hours a day for the past 2 weeks.

,Basketball,"I know tryouts are around the corner so i felt like just giving some pointers.

1. This is definitely the most important, you WILL NOT be playing the same type of basketball you play at the park, you are a high schooler, there is no way in hell your coach is just going to send you out there to iso, you will probably have zero iso plays, you are playing 5v5 team basketball, you will be passing, you will be setting screens, you will be boxing out, it's not as fun as streetball ill admit, but it's game winning basketball, sometimes you wont even get to shoot an open shot because the coach doesn't want you to, this type of basketball will not look like street ball or the NBA, just watch some of your high schools basketball games online and you will se what im talking about.

2. Be a team player, no one likes a ball hog, and if you show yourself to be one at tryouts, unless you're the next james harden, you will get cut, pass, pass, and pass, set screens for teammates that dont have the ball, also, dont try to do any crazy stepback deep 3s instead of passing,  even if you make it, you might think it looks cool, but it's definitely going to give you a bad image.

3. Defense is everything, box out, even if you aren't in the paint, you should be boxing out, if you are decently close there is still a chance the ball will come to you, especially off of 3 pointers, get really good at off ball defense, i see so many guys that can score but are a complete liability on the other end so they end up getting cut, be aggressive but make sure not to foul to often.

,Basketball,"This is what I heard the other day when I was leaving my gym.

Two girls were chilling near the basketball court at the back of my gym complex. They were watching a 3-on-3 game which abruptly ended when the biggest guy decided to jump straight up, knock the defender flat on his ass and dunk on him while he was laying sprawled on the blacktop.

That's when the blonde cheekily whispered this confession to her smoking-hot Asian friend in pink sweatpants:

""Nothing's hotter than a guy who can dunk.""

And can you guess what the Asian hottie replied? She whimpered:

""Uh huhhh!""

This got me thinking. I mean, for as long as I can remember I've always wanted to dunk. It's been a lifelong dream of mine, but I really had no idea girls found it hot. I guess it makes sense though since most people have this belief you need to be the most athletic dude around to be able to jump that high.

But the fact is that's just not true anymore.

Breakthrough research has surfaced recently about the exact 'levers' which allow people to jump ridiculously high. So naturally, 2 genius basketball players took this research and used it to transform regular guys who can't even touch the rim into dudes who can dunk with 2 hands every time and with ease.

One of these geniuses is a pro basketball player and the other is the world's highest dunker (I think it's safe to say they know what they're doing LOL) They're getting a ton of media hype these days and blowing up on YouTube so I thought I'd let you know about them.

And it's great timing too since they've just released all their crazy vert jump body hacks and techniques. They've been teaching people this stuff in secret for years but now it's available to the public in a badass program.

&amp;#x200B;

It's pretty crazy stuff so check it out.

* Even with the spam removal and rules that we've tried to put in place, we can probably all agree that there are just way too many posts that are the same question/same topic over and over. We're looking for a moderator that has mod experience and can help with sub upkeep. That means: being able to manually remove spam links, and to be able to create rules that auto filter spam posts (determined by the mod team). We don't expect you to be on 24/7 but are looking for reddit-heavy users.

* Creativity: If you're creative and have mod experience helping with design/look of a subreddit, please reach out to us. Shoutout to /u/theReluctantHipster for taking care of this in the past. We're looking for someone that has the creativity to come up with a new look for our logo, header, sidebar, etc. Really anything that can be changed is fair game.

Lebron, when asked when he started lifting, said 24 years old. Which means Lebron was a number 1 ranked high school football prospect and in the NBA at 18 years old 240 pounds overpowering grown ass men WITHOUT A SERIOUS WEIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM...

The fact that Lebron is still doing the same head over rim dunks and blocks, playing the Point Forward style at that size &amp; at the age of 36 without ever having a truly serious injury is unbelievable.

,Basketball," 

\[ Just wanna preface this by saying that I've been an athlete since my teens and been lifting weights seriously since I was in my early 20's. I've also been bodybuilding for about 5 years. So keep in mind that I'm a little more advanced that the average guy so I have a good foundation (Male, 29yo, 6'0"", \~210 lbs) \]

For about ten years, I've been trying to jump higher so I can dunk. I always tailored my leg training towards jumping higher and emulating basketball workouts. I kept trying but I never got there. It wasn't until I started studying the training of NFL athletes that the changes started coming. NFL players are absolute monsters. People might not realize that most Football players can run and jump as well (if not better) than NBA guys, and do so while being absolute slabs of muscle. NBA players work with lighter weights and do a lot of work on stability, and flexibility. Not saying NFL players don't do that too but it's not as much of a priority for them. They do a lot of heavy ass lifting including a lot of variations of compound lifts like squats, deads, oly lifts, etc.. Then incorporating that with explosive movement exercises like plyometrics and sprinting among other things. I've lifted heavy for legs before but not specifically like that.

So I thought, hey, those NFL guys are super athletic and jacked as hell, which is my goal. Why not train like them? So for about 4 months I trained like them and lo and behold, I was seeing steady monthly progress. My latest vert test had me at \~36""

Then recently I came upon a basketball court in a condo complex. This is the first time I've been able to use a basketball rim in months. So just to try it out I started testing my jump with it. I was so freaking shocked how easy getting up there had become. I was getting my wrist over the rim from a standing jump and with a running start, I could get my mid-forearm over the rim. I borrowed some kids ball and was able to dunk it no problem. So for those who've been struggling to jump higher and get up, I recommend looking into NFL or maybe even Rugby style training to get you there. You'll get bigger, stronger, and faster.

I'll share my program down below so you have an idea of what I did. Of course you don't have to do exactly what I did, but you can incorporate some of my stuff into whatever you're already doing. And also, I've been bulking for a few months which has helped me get stronger. So I advise you eat enough protein, carbs, and fat to get big and strong. But eat clean and try not to go overboard and get fat.

**WORKOUT SPLIT**: Push-Pull-Legs-Push-Pull-Legs-Rest (Upper body days are mostly bodybuilding oriented with heavy powerlifting type rep schemes for the big compounds) (I switch up the specific exercises every workout but the format is the same)(Variation = any exercise of that type)

(My leg workouts are divided into 2 days: Strength and Power days)

**LEGS (POWER)**  
a. Dynamic warmup: warmup drills (like you're warming up for a football game)(5-10 min) , Tuck Jumps (3 sets @ 8 reps), Jump Rope (3 set @ 50 reps as fast as possible)  
b. Short Distance Sprints (Focus on acceleration rather than top speed)(3 sets @ 5-10 yards)  
c-d. Pick any 2 of these to do (Focus on being as explosive as you can, if your power output is lowering, stop and rest until the next set)  
\--Box Jumps (3 sets @ 4-5 reps)  
\--One-Leg Power Hop (Jump forward as far/high as possible while staying on leg)(3 sets @ 5-6 reps/leg)

e. Barbell Hip Thrust (3 sets @ 8-10)  
f. Calf raises (3 sets @ 20-25) - Superset w/ any Abdominal Exercise (3 sets @ 12-15 reps)

b-d. Pick any 3 of these to do (Focus on being as explosive as you can, if your power output is lowering, stop and rest until the next set)  
\--Box Jumps (3 sets @ 4-5 reps)  
\--One-Leg Power Hop (Jump forward as far/high as possible while staying on leg)(3 sets @ 5-6 reps/leg)  
\--Depth Jumps (3 sets @ 4-5 reps)  
\--Max Height Standing Jump (3 sets @ 3-4 reps)  
\--1-Step Jumps to touch high object (3 sets @ 3-4 reps)  
f. Heavy Back Squats (5 sets @ 3-5 reps x3, 6-8 reps x2)  
d. Any Deadlift Variation (5 sets @ 8-10) (Focus less on weight and more one on exploding up with each rep)  
f. Calf raises (3 sets @ 20-25) - Superset w/ any Abdominal Exercise (3 sets @ 12-15 reps)

**NOTES ON MY WORKOUTS**  
\-Sometimes I change the exercises if some equipment is being used or I feel like doing something else  
\-If you know how to properly (and safely) do Hang/Power Cleans, you can use that as a substitute for the Weighted Jump Variation or Power Day Squat Variation (I used to do them but I messed up my wrist and now I can't do it without pain)  
\-For the heavy back squats, you can use high or low bar. I use both depending on how I feel that day  
\-For all other squat variations aside from Heavy back squats, use high bar since it's more mechanically similar to a vertical jump",t2_ajkea,False,,0,False,"How I increased my vertical jump by NOT training like a basketball player (from 31"" to ~36"")",[],r/Basketball,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_m0306i,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},IMPROVING MY GAME,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615190262.0,text,6,,,text,self.Basketball,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Just wanna preface this by saying that I&amp;#39;ve been an athlete since my teens and been lifting weights seriously since I was in my early 20&amp;#39;s.

,Basketball,"So I'm starting to workout this year and I'm just curious if I'll be able to increase my vertical my 1 foot? I rarely workout, but I'm starting to commit to it, so don't picture me as a muscular guy.

I am 6'2 (I'm 1/4 away from actually being 6'2)

Weight: 213

Wingspan: 6'5

My reach: 8 feet

Body Type: Tall and fat, but not too fat.... in between skinny fat and fat.

Current vertical: more than 2 feet (rough estimate, but I know it's a lil bit more than 2 feet. Probably 22-24 inches)

How did I measure my verticle? I had a measuring tape by my wall and I bent down and jumped up. I'm certain that I passed 2 feet.

I was thinking about dropping down from 213lbs to 190lbs and gain muscle, since I hardly have any. Focus on leg and try to increase my vertical by 1 foot.


Keep in mind that I don't have a proper jumping technique, so if I work on that, lose 23 pounds, and gain muscle. You think I'll have a shot at having a verticle of 3 feet? My goal is to dunk a ball on a 10 foot rim.

I run up to the rim on my tipitoes, plant both my feet planted flat on the ground, while squatting and throwing my hands behind my back, before releasing and myself like a spring at the rim.

With this method, I can only reach up to about halfway on the net.

When I do a layup, I barely even get up.

Is there a way I can improve my techinque, which is a bit faster and more effective than mine?

How can I make myself lighter and more springy on my feet? I want to get higher on my layups, but I don't really get up all that high.

Is there any exercises I can do with limited space (as the basketball court and my flat is quite small) to help me with jumping higher?

,Basketball,"Canadians!!!

Upon the Raptors recent successes on the sport's biggest stage, I thought to myself, how could the country that invented basketball not have a league of its own? I then did some research and came across two leagues, the CEBL and the NBLC, which, once combined, could form a 15 team respectable league. It could be Canada's top flight, drafting both Canadian university graduates but also players from around the world. 

I've realized that there are tensions between the front offices of each team, however I think the potential benefits of a merger could far outweigh any sort of friction between owners. I created a structure combining both leagues that I think will create bitter rivalries and draw attention from coast to coast:

Even though their teams cover different regions of the country, there is still a potential for fierce rivalries to be built (between the NBLC's KW titans and the CEBL's Guelph Nighthawks for example). When comparing teams of both leagues and their facilities, there really isn't a glaring disparity (all stadiums fit at least 4,000 fans). The time of the year at which the leagues take place may be different, but I think a summer schedule would be better as it's the NBA's offseason and also gives players from European leagues to get some playing time in between their seasons.

A 3 conference structure seemed best for me, arranged as following:

|Atlantic Division:|Great Lakes Division:|Pacific Division:|
|:-|:-|:-|
|St John's Edge (NBLC)|Guelph Nighthawks  (CEBL)|Saskatoon Rattlers (CEBL)|
|Island Storm (NBLC)|Niagara River Lions  (CEBL)|Edmonton Stingers (CEBL)|
|Halifax Hurricanes (NBLC)|Hamilton Honey Badgers (CEBL)|Fraser Vally Bandits (CEBL)|
|Moncton Magic (NBLC)|Kitchener-Waterloo Titans (NBLC)|Sudbury Five (NBLC)|
|Ottawa Blackjacks (CEBL)|London Lightning (NBLC)|Windsor Express (NBLC)|

Over the regular season, teams will play others in the same conference 3 times and others twice, for a total of 32 games. This is down from the NBLC's usual 40 but up from the CEBL's regular 20. As a plus, this will only flare up the already existing rivalries between cities in similar divisions.

The playoffs will combine everything NBA fans have longed for; a play-in wild card tournament and reseed teams before the playoffs like March Madness. The top 2 teams in each conference qualify automatically, earning seeds 1-6 depending on their record and strength of schedule. The following 4 teams in terms of record will enter a single-elimination play-in tournament, with the finalists taking the last two wild card spots. The winner of the play-in tournament gets the 7 seed and the loser the 8th seed.

The rest of the playoffs go as normal; the 1 seed plays the 8 seed, the 2 seed with the 7, 3 vs 6, and 4 vs 5. Each round will be a best-of-5 series, with the higher seed hosting games 1,2 and 5 (if necessary).

For those who don't think this could happen, remember that the NBA originated from a merger between itself and the ABA. The same goes for the NFL and MLB. To me, it seems like the only thing stopping this merger would be the heads of each league not wanting to collaborate.

,Basketball,"Hi guys,

I need help to improve my gameplay on court. Sometime I played pick up games with random peoples and when I called a foul, they don't want to admit and tell me to play more hard (contacts), sometime they will call me ""soft"". For me, this is crazy, because I played usually in a regular game, and the refs will always call that fouls.

The uncalled fouls are :

* Using shoulder and elbow when dribling to push the defensive player on offense (whole body)
* Using elbow after pick a rebound or when (offball) guard on defense
* When we drive, their hand will always try to hit the ball even hit our hands (not just hands up)
* When we drive and pullup (jump shot or layup), their body will enter our zone and hit our body

Do you guys have been in the same situation like me?

What we must do when we played with them?

Sorry for my bad english.
